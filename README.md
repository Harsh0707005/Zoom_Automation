# Zoom Automation
There are many students and professionals who are too lazy to join the Zoom Meeting manually <i>(including me ;P )</i>.
<br>So this is a simple python script that lets you join a zoom meeting at a scheduled time, without any human interference.

<h2> Usage</h2>

Just import the <em>.py</em> file, change the following parts in the <i>data (links.txt)</i> and the script:
<ul>
  <li>Change the timings of the meeting in the <i>.py</i> file (if necessary add more meetings by creating more <em>elif</em> statements but the code will be same as others).</li>
  <li>Change the meeting links in the <em>Links.txt</i> (mind the sequence of the links according to time)</li>
</ul>
